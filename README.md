# Transitions

Are you a individual striving for better but not sure where to get the learning tools necessary? look no further!

## Motivation

We created transitions with the thought in mind of giving people the tools necessary to help them transition into adulthood with the knowledge and understanding of topics that sometimes aren't taught well enough in school.

The user will be able to select from 9 different topics and each topic presents videos and articles that will help you understanding of how each of the different topics work! 



## API Reference

Transitions is based on the API calls of YouTube and NEWS heavily to get the information necessary to help the user.
